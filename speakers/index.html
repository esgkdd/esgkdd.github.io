            <font size="4">DCWiz: Transforming Data Center Operations and Management (O&M) with AI<br>
            <br>
            <font size="2">Data center, dedicated space to house computer systems and associated components, plays an important role in propelling digital transformation globally, especially in the presence of a global pandemic (e.g., COVID-19). The resulted extensive use of services such as cloud, big data, IoT and artificial intelligence is prompting DC operators to consolidate high-performance mission critical IT infrastructure in hyper-scale data centers. In practice, data centers are managed and optimized towards two operational objectives: 1) business resilience, serving to evaluate the commercial impact of service disruption, and 2) operations sustainability, serving to evaluate the cost of providing services. AI solutions, made popular by Google DeepMind, have been touted with great potential to optimize the aforementioned operational metrics. However, adopting AI techniques for data center operations and management (O&M) faces substantial challenges in data availability and deployment inhibitors. In this talk, we present DCWiz, a transformative industrial AI solution that integrates an industry-grade digital twin with emerging AI techniques to digitalize, optimize and automate data center O&M for operational excellence. Specifically, DCWiz leverages advanced AI techniques (e.g., deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial network) to train an industry-grade digital twin for any physical data center, in terms of data accuracy, and deploy the digital twin as a pivotal module to provide descriptive, predictive and prescriptive AI for DC O&M. We delve into two use cases, namely hot-spot management and PUE optimization, to show that DCWiz would potentially lead to 30% of cooling cost saving in tropical environments. We further share several commercial trials with Alibaba, Singapore National Supercomputing Center (NSCC), Singapore, each of which represents different applications of the DCWiz solution. The trial results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCWiz solution in improving manageability, reducing cost and mitigating operational risks for mission-critical data centers.<br>

            <br>
            <font size="2">Steve Jobs had a knack of making things beautifully simple to use. He had a brilliant way of presenting products too. And he always had “…. Just one more thing.” ESG needs those 3 things too. So I called him.  And in this special session, you’ll see the result of putting all of that together in a way that removes the complexity of ESG and the SDGs too.  You’ll see how one tiny Singapore-based company combined with 3,000 others to create over 250,000,000 impacts.  You’ll see how, by working together in simple ways, we really can bring these important things together so that at last we can use the power of small to make a huge difference in our world.<br>
            <br>
            <font size="2">Bio: Paul is a 4-time TEDx speaker. He is a Senior Fellow in one of the World’s Leading Think Tanks and consults to and mentors leading-edge businesses around the world.
